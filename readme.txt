Git is a distributed version contorl system.
Git is free software under the GPL.
I am learning from Liao Xuefeng's Git Tutorial.

1st class: initialize git repository, then add file, finally commit.
2nd class: git status, git log.
3rd class: git reset --hard HEAD^, git reset --hard xxxxxx
4th class: if add then "git reset HEAD file" to unstage, then "git checkout --file"

In git, the changes are uploaded to index(stage) by "add" then merge to master branch by "commit"
Update from RP3
